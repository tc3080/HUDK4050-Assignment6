# HUDK4050-Assignment6

## Task I
You will be working in groups on a quantified student project
Download the Sensor Kinetics Pro app to your iOS or Android device (or similar gyroscope measuring app)
Split into subgroups with each subgroup investigating one measures available in the app
Each subgroup shopuld report back aafter 20min with what they have learned

## Task II
In consultation with your group select a physical activity that: a) can be measured using the app, b) has a concrrete, sontinuous, countable outcome and c) some members of the group are experts and some are novices at - If you are looking for inspiration you can find previous student projects below.
Collect measurements for all members of the group performing the task using the app
Create a Github repo where you can store and share your data
Using K-means, can you identify the novices from the experts using only the app data?
Visualize your results using ggplot2

## Task III
Devise five questions on a five point Likert scale that ask members of your group about their experience with your chosen task
Collect data from all members of your group
Run a PCA analysis on the data
What does PC1 represent in your analysis?
Visualize the PC1 results for each member of your group

## Task IV
If you could only choose one thing to predict the score for each member of your group (raw data variable, a cluster or a PC) what would it be and why?
Create a visualization that supports your conclusion
Based on your conclusion devise an intervention that would help novice members of your group imporve their performance

## Task V
Submit a link to your Github repo containing your data, code, visualizations and conclusions to charles.lang@tc.columbia.edu by 5pm EDT 12/14/20.
